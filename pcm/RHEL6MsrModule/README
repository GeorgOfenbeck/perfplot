====== MSR Module for Red Hat Linux Enterprise Linux =======

Building and installation

Requirements
------------------------------
The module depends on udev, g++ and the kernel sources

Notes:
------------------------------
1. 	This module is initially designed for RHEL6. However it
	is compatible with (almost) any Linux distribution
2.	The make file creates a module named 'perfplot', which is
	identical to the initial MSR driver. However, the MAJOR
	number can no longer be 202 (the initial MSR MAJOR num),
	since MSR driver can potentially be running, especially 
	if MSR module is statically linked to the kernel.
	Therefore the new module has a MAJOR number of 234. In 
	case this MAJOR number is already taken by another device, 
	it must be changed in perfplot.c. To check the used device
	major numbers, just execute cat /proc/devices
3.	When the module is started, it creates char devices in
	/dev/cpu/%d/perfplot. There are no conflicts even if the 
	initial MSR driver is running, and both can run 
	simultaneously.
4.	The module does not start automatically on boot. This can
	be resolved by adding the module in /etc/modules.conf

Automatic install
------------------------------
1. 	yum install kernel-devel
2. 	make
3. 	su
4. 	make install
5. 	modprobe perfplot


PCM Binary Compilation
------------------------------
Since the path of the char devices to read the MSRs is changed
to /dev/cpu/%d/perfplot, this must be adjusted in the PCM tool.
To do so, just compile it with:

make MSRDEVNAME=perfplot
